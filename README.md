# random-as-regularization
This repository contains codes for simulations in the paper Randomization as Regularization: A Degrees of Freedom Explanation for Random Forest Success (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00190). 

The 3 folders DoF, Performance Comparison and RandFS contain the simulations in the Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5 of the paper respectively. Some functions used are taken directly from the R package best-subset which is available at https://github.com/ryantibs/best-subset.
